# qualysCVEPairing

I made this so that anyone that works with Qualys can get a constantly updating list of CVES, their descriptions, and their QIDs. 
This should make it so it's possible to be ingested into splunk via a clean CSV. 

# qualysSchedules

A way to curate a CSV containing all future scans. (Also makes an xlsx because excel doesn't like high amounts of commas in a cell, which a large list of IPs can do.)

Feel free to let me know what I can do to make this a lil more clean. My plan is to turn these all into modules soon.
